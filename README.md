V 0.1
### Created by Peter Wells

## Purpose
This app is designed to  improved your sense of timing by gamifying your accuracy to a target rhythm which you set.

## How to use
Simply press play and try to hit the notes on time with either the tap button on the control panel or the 's' key on your keyboard.

## Known Bugs
* ~~Currently there is a known issue where sometimes the next tick will come back as NaN if there are no targets set or if it hasn't reached that target note yet.~~
* Appears to have compatability issues with Firefox as well. Audio engine will periodically stop running and start.
